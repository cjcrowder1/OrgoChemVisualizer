The following are long-form descriptions of the reactions that are
animated in OrgoChemVisualizer. Please see [insert reference here]
for more details.

Addition of HBr to Alkenes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Addition of HBr to Alkenes mechanism follows the reaction of an
alkene, which is a molecule with a double bond between two Carbon
molecules, and Hydrogen Bromide, or HBr. This mechanism takes place
in two steps: Protonation of alkene and Addition of Br to carbocation.
In the protonation step, the Hydrogen in HBr is drawn towards the
double bond of the alkene while the bond between the Hydrogen and Bromide
atoms stretches until it is broken, and simultaneously, the double bond in
the alkene is also broken into a single bond. The Hydrogen bonds with one
of the Carbons, and leaves the other Carbon, that was part of the C=C bond,
with a positive charge. In the second step, the Bromide ion, Br-, is drawn 
to the positive charge left on the other Carbon, and forms a single bond with 
it. This molecule is called an alkyl bromide. This mechanism can also be
performed with HCl, Hydrogen Chloride.

SN2 Reaction with Alkyl Halides
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

An SN2 reaction mechanism is a Nucleophilic Substitution in which the Rate
Determining Step of the reaction involves 2 components: the concentration of
both the substrate and the nucleophile. Alkyl Halides are compounds in which
one or more Hydrogen atoms in an alkane have been replaced by halogen atoms, 
such as Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, or Iodine). This SN2 reaction with Alkyl
Halides consists of 2-bromopropane, an alkane of three Carbon atoms with 7 
Hydrogen atoms and one Bromine atom attached with single bonds, this is the 
Alkyl Halide; and a Hydroxide which consists of one Oxygen atom and one 
Hydrogen atom, this is the nucleophile. A Hydroxide molecule has a negative 
charge since the Oxygen atom has one extra pair of electrons, the molecule does 
not have the same amount of positive charges as negative charges.  Because of
this, the Hydroxide wants to become neutral.  In this reaction, the extra pair 
of electrons in the Oxygen atom of the Hydroxide are drawn to the Alkyl Halide.
Simultaneously, the electron pair breaks the bond between the Bromine and Carbon 
atoms and forms a new bond with the Carbon. This new molecule is called Methanol
and is an alcohol.

E1 Mechanism
""""""""""""

An E1 mechanism is also known as an Elimination 1 reaction, in this mechanism 
two substituents, any atom/group other than Hydrogen on a molecule, are removed.
This reaction includes an Alkyl Halide, water, and heat to eliminate the 
substiuent. For this reaction, the Alkyl Halide is a molecule called: 
2-bromobutane, so the substituent is Bromine.  The first step of this reaction
is the breaking of the bond between Carbon and Bromine, because Bromine is a good
Leaving Group, as are all halide ions, which leaves that Carbon with a positive 
charge. Due to the positive charge on the Carbon, the bond between the Hydrogen 
and the Carbon, the one with the methyl group, is broken to neutralize the positve
Carbon with a double bond, C=C. Simultaneously, the Oxygen in the H2O molecule 
bonds with the detaching Hydrogen, forming H3O+, also known as the hydronium ion.
This elimination mechanism results with the products: 1,2-dimethylcyclohexene, 
H3O+, and Br-.
