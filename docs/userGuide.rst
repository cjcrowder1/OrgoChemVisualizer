The following are long-form descriptions of the reactions that are
animated in OrgoChemVisualizer. Please see [insert reference here]
for more details.

Addition of HBr to Alkenes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The Addition of HBr to Alkenes mechanism follows the reaction of an
alkene, which is a molecule with a double bond between two Carbon
molecules, and Hydrogen Bromide, or HBr. This mechanism takes place
in two steps: Protonation of alkene and Addition of Br to carbocation.
In the protonation step, the Hydrogen in HBr is drawn towards the
double bond of the alkene while the bond between the Hydrogen and Bromide
atoms stretches until it is broken, and simultaneously, the double bond in
the alkene is also broken into a single bond. The Hydrogen bonds with one
of the Carbons, and leaves the other Carbon, that was part of the C=C bond,
with a positive charge. In the second step, the Bromide ion, Br-, is drawn 
to the positive charge left on the other Carbon, and forms a single bond with 
it. This molecule is called an alkyl bromide. This mechanism can also be
performed with HCl, Hydrogen Chloride.

SN2 Reaction with Alkyl Halides
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

An SN2 reaction mechanism is a Nucleophilic Substitution in which the Rate
Determining Step of the reaction involves 2 components: the concentration of
both the substrate and the nucleophile. Alkyl Halides are compounds in which
one or more Hydrogen atoms in an alkane have been replaced by halogen atoms, 
such as Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, or Iodine). This SN2 reaction with Alkyl
Halides consists of 2-bromopropane, an alkane of three Carbon atoms with 7 
Hydrogen atoms and one Bromine atom attached with single bonds, this is the 
Alkyl Halide; and a Hydroxide which consists of one Oxygen atom and one 
Hydrogen atom, this is the nucleophile. A Hydroxide molecule has a negative 
charge since the Oxygen atom has one extra pair of electrons, the molecule does 
not have the same amount of positive charges as negative charges.  Because of
this, the Hydroxide wants to become neutral.  In this reaction, the extra pair 
of electrons in the Oxygen atom of the Hydroxide are drawn to the Alkyl Halide.
Simultaneously, the electron pair breaks the bond between the Bromine and Carbon 
atoms and forms a new bond with the Carbon. This new molecule is called Methanol
and is an alcohol.

E1 Mechanism
""""""""""""

An E1 mechanism is also known as an Elimination 1 reaction, in this mechanism 
two substituents, any atom/group other than Hydrogen on a molecule, are removed.
This reaction includes an alcohol and H2SO4 to eliminate the 
oxygen from the molecule, and eventually forming an alkene. For this reaction, the 
alcohol is a molecule called: ethanol and the alkene formed from this reaction is ethanol.  
This reaction is also known as the dehydration of ethanol.
The first step of this reaction is the protonation of the alcohol which is achieved when 
the lone pairs of elections on the oxygen picks up a hydrogen ion from the sulphuric acid (H2SO4),
the -OH group then becomes -OH2 with the addition of the hydrogen ion.  In the next step, the
H2O leaves the molecule because it is a good leaving group, this forms a carbocation.  The carbocation
molecule experiences the removal of a hydrogen ion in order to form a double bond between the two Carbons, 
and forming ethene (CH2=CH2).
