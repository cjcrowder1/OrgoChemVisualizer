Welcome to OrgoChemVisualizer's documentation!
==============================================

OrgoChemVisualizer is software written for anyone interested in learning organic 
chemistry reaction mechanisms.  It currently animates three common
organic mechanisms: 

* Addition of HBr to Alkenes

* SN2 Reaction with Alkyl Halides

* E1 Mechanism

An SN2 reaction mechanism is a Nucleophilic Substitution in which the Rate Determining Step of the reaction
involves 2 components: the concentration of both the substrate and the nucleophile. Alkyl Halides are compounds 
in which one or more Hydrogen atoms in an alkane have been replaced by halogen atoms, such as Fluorine, Chlorine, 
Bromine, or Iodine).  This SN2 reaction with Alkyl Halides consists of 2-bromopropane, an alkane of three Carbon atoms
with 7 Hydrogen atoms and one Bromine atom attached with single bonds, this is the Alkyl Halide; and a Hydroxide
which consists of one Oxygen atom and one Hydrogen atom, this is the nucleophile.  A Hydroxide molecule has a negative 
charge since the Oxygen atom has one extra pair of electrons, the molecule does not have the same amount of positive charges
as negative charges.  Because of this, the Hydroxide wants to become neutral.  In this reaction, the extra pair of electrons 
in the Oxygen atom of the Hydroxide are drawn to the Alkyl Halide.  Simultaneously, the electron pair breaks the bond between
the Bromine and Carbon atoms and forms a new bond with the Carbon.  This new molecule is called Methanol and is an alcohol.

An E1 mechanism is also known as an Elimination 1 reaction, in this mechanism 2 substituents, any atom/group other than Hydrogen
on a molecule, are removed.  This reaction includes an Alkyl Halide, water, and heat to eliminate the substiuent.  For this reaction, 
the Alkyl Halide is a molecule called: 2-bromobutane, so the substituent is Bromine.  The first step of this reaction
is the breaking of the bond between Carbon and Bromine, because Bromine is a good Leaving Group, as are all halide ions, which leaves
that Carbon with a positive charge.  Due to the positive charge on the Carbon, the bond between the Hydrogen and the Carbon, the one with 
the methyl group, is broken to neutralize the positve Carbon with a double bond, C=C.  Simultaneously, the Oxygen in the H2O molecule 
bonds with the detaching Hydrogen, forming H3O+, also known as the hydronium ion.  This elimination mechanism results with the products: 
1,2-dimethylcyclohexene, H3O+, and Br-.
